# 2024 Avionics tutorial reference board!!
Here's where you'll find my basic example of a possible flight computer board using the RP2040 microcontroller, it also shows that it is possible to design a board that will fit the minimum rocket tube diameter of 50mm.

We will provide these board template sizes:
* 66mm x 66mm (Will fit in a L2 rocket)
* 85mm x 85mm

> [!NOTE]
> While it is possbile to make a 50mm x 50mm board, it's not recommended as routing all the components is quite tricky. We'd suggest the 66mm x 66mm template, which would still fit in a L2 rocket (70mm tube) for if you choose to progress to the L2 project. We also aim to provide a 85mm x 85mm template as well.

## Resources / Datasheets
**_Please look_** at the datasheets for any of the major components you plan to use e.g. (Voltage regulator, RP2040, Flash chip, Screen, USB-C connector, ect..) They provide the information necessary on how to integrate them with your project and if any extra components are needed for them to work correctly.

The Raspberry Pi Foundation has provided a massive amount of technical information for the RP2040 microcontroller we use, so I'd suggest having a look over their datasheets to help build your boards! They definitely helped me :)

If you have any questions about the example board, then come talk to me!  
Happy making! (The first year Grayson) :3
