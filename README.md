# 2024 Avionics tutorial example boards!!
Here's where you'll find basic examples of a flight computer board using the RP2040 microcontroller. 

We have two different example sizes.  
(50mm x 50mm) This shows it's possible to design a 2-layer 50mm x 50mm board to fit the minimum rocket tube diameter of 50mm. Made by Grayson. This is the one we have ordered and will be avalible to pass around.
(66mm x 66mm) This 2-layer example board is slightly bigger but small enough to fit in an L2 rocket. Made by Kaden.  

> [!NOTE]
> While making a 2-layer 50mm x 50mm board is possible, routing something this small can be quite a puzzle especially to do nicely. It will mean though that you could use a 4-layer board which helps a bit. Otherwise, we'd suggest something like 66mm x 66mm, which would still fit in an L2 rocket (70mm tube). If your not planning on doing level 2 feel free to go upto the max size of 100mm x 90mm.

> [!CAUTION]
> We are not experts and are still all learning a lot ourselves. As such some of these designs may be suboptimal, don't take them as best practice. If you see an issue with any of the boards, or even just think you do, feel free to create an issue so we can all learn.

## Resources / Datasheets
**_Please look_** at the datasheets for any major components you plan to use, e.g. (Voltage regulator, RP2040, Flash chip, Screen, LEDs, USB-C connector, etc..) They provide the information necessary to integrate them with your project and if any extra components are needed to work correctly.

The Raspberry Pi Foundation has provided a massive amount of technical information for the RP2040 microcontroller we use, so I'd suggest reviewing their datasheets to help build your boards! They definitely helped me :)

If you have any questions about the example board, then come talk to me!  
Happy making! (The first year Grayson) :3
