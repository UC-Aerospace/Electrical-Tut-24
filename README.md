# 2024 Avionics tutorial example boards!!
Here's where you'll find basic examples of a flight computer board using the RP2040 microcontroller. 

We have two different example sizes.  
(50mm x 50mm) This shows it's possible to design a 2-layer 50mm x 50mm board to fit the minimum rocket tube diameter of 50mm. Made by Grayson.  
(66mm x 66mm) This 2-layer example board is slightly bigger but small enough to fit in an L2 rocket. Made by Kaden.  

> [!NOTE]
> While making a 2-layer 50mm x 50mm board is possible, it's not recommended, as routing all the components is quite tricky.  If you still want to try stick to a 50mm x 50mm board, you'll need at least a 4-layer board. Otherwise, we'd suggest something like 66mm x 66mm, which would still fit in an L2 rocket (70mm tube). Something to remember if you want to progress to the L2 project. (You do get up to a max size of 100mm x 100mm, so don't feel like it has to be this small)

## Resources / Datasheets
**_Please look_** at the datasheets for any major components you plan to use, e.g. (Voltage regulator, RP2040, Flash chip, Screen, LEDs, USB-C connector, etc..) They provide the information necessary to integrate them with your project and if any extra components are needed to work correctly.

The Raspberry Pi Foundation has provided a massive amount of technical information for the RP2040 microcontroller we use, so I'd suggest reviewing their datasheets to help build your boards! They definitely helped me :)

Happy making! (The first year Grayson) :3
